# Spotify Song & Genre Analysis, Popularity Prediction and Building a Simple Recommendation System
This project was carried out within the scope of SabancÄ± University CS210 Introduction to Data Science course. The following steps were made using various [Spotify data](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks):

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**

    - Visualizations Descriptive Statistics
    - Example Visualizations of Aggregated Forms Based on Features
    - Analysis of the Most Popular Artists and Songs
    - How Songs of Different Genres Change Over Time
    - Comparison of features of sub-genres for selected parent genres over time periods

- **Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing**

    - Statistical tests to check how (or if) features contribute to popularity of songs
    - Statistical tests to check if significant differences exist between different eras
    - Statistical tests on sub-genres
    
- **Machine Learning**

    - Prediction of song popularity with machine learning models
        - Linear Regression
        - k-Nearest Neighbors
        - Decision Tree
        - Random Forest
        
    - Hyper-parameter tuning to increase the performance of models
    - Song recommendation system
    - Song clustering based on available features and relate them with existing genres
